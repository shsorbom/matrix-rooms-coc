# The Dating, Relationship And Sexuality Room Code of Conduct
A Sex-positive Matrix Room to discuss love, relationships and sexuality

## Overview
This is a room to discuss topics related to dating, love, and human sexuality from a sex positive perspective. Sex positivity is a movement which promotes, 
> [...]the recognition of sexuality (in the countless forms of expression) as a natural and healthy part of the human experience and emphasizing the importance of personal sovereignty, safer sex practices, and consensual sex (free from violence or coercion). It covers every aspect of sexual identity including gender expression, orientation, relationship to the body (body-positivity, nudity, choice), relationship-style choice, reproductive rights, and anything else society has lumped under the umbrella."
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex-positive_movement)

Covering the issues of love, sexuality, and dating from this perspective means that this room aims to be as nonjudgmental as possible towards individual lifestyle practices and choices. It was envisioned as a safe place to discuss niche forms of sexuality from this perspective, and to offer general advice on more mainstream topics relating to the aforementioned parts of this room's title.

Some disagreements over what constitutes acceptable sexual practices are inevitable, and we ask that individuals choosing to partake of this conversation operate on a policy of "your kink is not my kink, but your kink is okay", should disagreements arise.

That said, practices deemed to be blatantly unsafe are frowned upon.
